1.main branch - this is where the team leader merges all the branches.

2. prototype branch - this branch can only be found
on the team leaders repoitory.

3. 218257465 branch - this branch is named with the team leaders student number,
on a team members repository it should be named with that team member's student number.

4. the (student number branch) on each team members repository
is used to track the contributions of each team member.

5. Every team member except the team leader should have 2 branches,
the forked main branch from the team leader and a branch named with their student number.

6. A team member should have the final version of the team leader's
main branch before pulling a request for merging.

7. Every pull request to merge should be sent from a 
team members (student number branch) to the (prototype branch) on the team leaders repository.

8. Always pull a request to merge from the team leader's (main branch) to your main branch,
then from your main branch to your student number branch.

9. If a team member does not follow any of these guidelines, 
the team leader will not accept the pull request of the team member.

10. A comment will be attached if a team members pull request was not accepted.

11. If a team member does not respond to the denied pull request
another team member will fix the error and be credited as one of the authors
